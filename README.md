# machine-learning-in-crowd-modelling

This repository includes all implementations created during the course "Machine Learning in Crowd Modelling and Simulation" (MLCMS) at TUM. The different assignments each have its own folder and are covering the following topics:

## [exercise01](https://github.com/Climbnote/machine-learning-in-crowd-modelling/tree/main/exercise01) Modeling crowd dynamics
Implementation of a cellular automaton with visualization in Python
## [exercise02](https://github.com/Climbnote/machine-learning-in-crowd-modelling/tree/main/exercise02) SIR models
Implementation of a SIR model into the existing simulation software Vadere in Java
## [exercise03](https://github.com/Climbnote/machine-learning-in-crowd-modelling/tree/main/exercise03) Dynamical systems and bifurcation theory
Solving and visualizing different dynamical systems (Andronov-Hopf Bifurcation) and chaotic systems (Lorenz attractor)
## [exercise04](https://github.com/Climbnote/machine-learning-in-crowd-modelling/tree/main/exercise04) Representation of data
Implementation of Principal Component Analysis, a Diffusion Map algorithm, and Variational Auto-Encoders in Python
## [exercise05](https://github.com/Climbnote/machine-learning-in-crowd-modelling/tree/main/exercise05) Extracting dynamical systems from data
Implementation of linear and non-linear function approximation, vector fields, and time-delay embedding
## [exercise06](https://github.com/Climbnote/machine-learning-in-crowd-modelling/tree/main/exercise06) Machine learning in crowd dynamics
Prediction of pedestrian dynamics in complex architectures with artificial neural networks in Python
