# machine-learning-in-crowd-modelling

This repository includes all implementations created during the course "Machine Learning in Crowd Modelling and Simulation" (MLCMS) at TUM.

The assignments have covered the following topics which are :

## [exercise 01](https://github.com/Climbnote/machine-learning-in-crowd-modelling/tree/main/exercise01) Modeling crowd dynamics: Implementation of a cellular automaton with visualization in Python
- Simulation software: Implementation of a SIR model into the existing simulation software Vadere in Java
- Dynamical systems and bifurcation theory: Solving and visualizing different dynamical systems (Andronov-Hopf Bifurcation) and chaotic systems (Lorenz attractor)
- Representation of data: Implementation of Principal Component Analysis, a Diffusion Map algorithm, and Variational Auto-Encoders in Python
- Extracting dynamical systems from data: Implementation of linear and non-linear function approximation, vector fields, and time-delay embedding
- Machine learning in crowd dynamics: Prediction of pedestrian dynamics in complex architectures with artificial neural networks in Python
